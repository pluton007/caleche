        Biscotti The Original Biscotto, these Biscotti bring me back in time as a young kid walking into my dad Bakery.
        These are hand crafted and mixed with nothing but the finest ingredients using all natural extracts like lemon
        zest, oranges , anise , chocolate , almonds , pistachio ... and ivnever use imitation flavors. I hand roll each
        biscotto log, let them cool a bit and hand cut. Then they go back in the oven not once but two more times to get
        that delicious texture . Small batch baking is a lot of work and time but that's the only way you get the best
        tasting and quality . NO PRESERVATIVES
        Ingredients on this biscotti are:
        Eggs, sugar, vegetable oil, fresh squeezed lemon ￼￼￼￼Lemon zest, flower, milk, vanilla.
        If you have any allergies please let me know when you place your order.
